# Predicting_cars_sales_prices--Dq.io_Machine_Learning
My take on Dq.io's guided machine learning project using the k-nearest-neighbors algorithm (knn regressor).

----------------------
Goal of this guided project is to practice the machine learning workflow. The data set we will be working with contains information on various cars. For each car we have information about the technical aspects of the vehicle such as the motor's displacement, the weight of the car, the miles per gallon, how fast the car accelerates, and more. You can read more about the data set and can download it directly from here.

Main goals
- Data cleaning with machine learning usage in mind
- Model construction
- Testing of different features and hyperparameters
- Visualizing the results and deciding for a model
